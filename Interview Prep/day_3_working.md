1) Where do  ‘Support Vector Machines’ get their name from?
They work by calculating a hyperplane that separates the data by class with the maximum distance from the nearest points. The vectors representing the distance from those nearest points to the hyperplane are the support vectors.

2) In terms of computational efficiency, which is better - logistic regression or SVM that uses the sigmoid kernel ‘trick’? Explain why.
